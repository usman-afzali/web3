This was part of my PhD research. It had the following aims:
-   Extension of the Think/No-Think paradigm 
-   The ability to suppress unwanted using the Think/No-Think paradigm in relation to two psychological traits (OCD and PTSD)
-   Using the Think/No-Think paradigm as a countermeasure in Brain Fingerprinting
This project was completed in collaboration with Prof Michael Anderson at the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, UK](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk).

## Achievements

-   I supervised early career research students undertaking Think/No-Think studies.
-   I work on an international Think/No-Think project as a Principal Investigator.
-   I was awarded a PhD scholarship to conduct this research.
