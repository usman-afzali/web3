Post 15 March terrorist attacks in New Zealand, I joined [Te Puna Toiora: Mental Health and Nutrition Research Lab](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/research/about-uc-research/research-groups-and-centres/te-puna-toiora-mental-health-and-nutrition-research) as a co-PI at University of Canterbury undertaking micronutrient intervention to address mental wellbeing of survivors and victims.
