**Role:** Researcher

Forensic Brainwave Analysis currently has three areas: [Brain Fingerprinting](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470061589.fsa1013) (BFP), [Complex Trial Protocol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18823418/) and [Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Electrical_Oscillation_Signature_Profiling).

BFP is an ERP*-based knowledge detection technology aiming to detect concealed knowledge pertaining to an incident (criminal or otherwise) in a person's brain. BFP can also detect if a certain person has knowledge specific to a specific group or organisation (e.g., FBI).

BFP was invented in the early 1990s by Dr Lawrence (Larry) Farwell - currently the Chief Science Officer of the Brain Fingerprinting Technologies.

During my PhD at University of Canterbury, I worked with academics from psychology and law in a [New Zealand Law Foundation](https://www.lawfoundation.org.nz/?p=8026) project to replicate the accuracy and reliability of the BFP technology with general population and with parolees.

An EEG headset (see the figure) and a computer software are used in this technology.

### Can we beat Brain Fingerprinting?
I have also investigated a cognitive psychology technique known as Think/No-Think in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, UK [read further](https://usman-afzali.github.io/web3/research/2019/01/tnt/index.html). Think/No-Think might be used as a countermeasure against BFP. There is a potential for prospective Honours, Masterâ€™s and PhD students to work with us on BFP and Think/No-Think at the University of Canterbury. This will tell us what type of people could employ Think/No-Think, and potentially beat BFP.

*ERP = Event-related potential*

## Achievement

-   I was awarded a PhD scholarship to conduct this research.
