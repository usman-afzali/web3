```{r}
df <- cars
df
```

To run each `line`, say for testing, use `command + return`.

## Including Plots

```{r}
plot(df$speed ~ df$dist)
```

You can also embed plots, for example: Here, `echo=FALSE` means that the code will not be shown.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(viridis)
```

## Viridis colours

```{r}
image(volcano, col = viridis(200, option = "A"))
```

## Adding callouts

::: callout-note
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::

## Citations and referencing

To include a citation, simply select `Citation` from `Insert` menu in `Visual` editor. Quarto can create citations using a variety of options including `Zotero`, `DOI`, `Crossref`, etc, and creates a `references.bib` file as a result.

For instance: [@afzali2023]
