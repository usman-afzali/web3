It had the following aims:\n-   Extension of the Think/No-Think paradigm \n-   The ability to suppress unwanted using the Think/No-Think paradigm in relation to two psychological traits (OCD and PTSD)\n-   Using the Think/No-Think paradigm as a countermeasure in Brain Fingerprinting\nThis project was completed in collaboration with Prof Michael Anderson at the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, UK](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk).\n\n\nPreregistration on [OSF](https://osf.io/zdb8u).\n\n## Achievements\n\n-   I supervised early career research students undertaking Think/No-Think studies.\n-   I work on an international Think/No-Think project as a Principal Investigator.\n\n## Publications\n\n1.
