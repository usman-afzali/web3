BFP can also detect if a certain person has knowledge specific to a specific group or organisation (e.g., FBI).\n\nBFP was invented in the early 1990s by Dr Lawrence (Larry) Farwell - currently the Chief Science Officer of the Brain Fingerprinting Technologies.\n\nDuring my PhD at University of Canterbury, I worked with academics from psychology and law in a [New Zealand Law Foundation](https://www.lawfoundation.org.nz/?p=8026) project to replicate the accuracy and reliability of the BFP technology with general population and with parolees.\n\nAn EEG headset (see the figure) and a computer software are used in this technology.\n\n![https://www.cgxsystems.com](quick-20r.png)\n\n### Can we beat Brain Fingerprinting?\nI have also investigated a cognitive psychology technique known as Think/No-Think in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, UK [read further](https://usman-afzali.github.io/web3/research/2019/01/tnt/index.html). Think/No-Think might be used as a countermeasure against BFP. There is a potential for prospective Honours, Masterâ€™s and PhD students to work with us on BFP and Think/No-Think at the University of Canterbury. This will tell us what type of people could employ Think/No-Think, and potentially beat BFP.\n\n*ERP = Event-related potential*\n\n## Achievement\n\n-   I was awarded a PhD scholarship to conduct this research.\n\n## Publications\n\n1.
