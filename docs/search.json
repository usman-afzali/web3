We simply call it the Muslim Diversity Study or MDS, in which I lead a team of 20+ researchers and various collaborators from New Zealand and overseas.\nNZAVS is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders that started in 2009. It is currently following 38,551 participants, almost 1% of the New Zealand’s adult population. Over 20% of NZAVS survey items were developed with global virtue experts to specifically investigate the interplay of religion, virtue, and flourishing as people age. Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand’s population, less than 2% of New Zealand’s Muslims are currently participating in the study (n = 70). The proposed project will build on existing Muslim community partnerships to boost the NZAVS Muslim sample by 3000 participants, thus enabling to explore Muslim flourishing longitudinally on a national level."

    "title": "Suppressing unwanted memories and thoughts: Psychological traits and forensic brainwave investigations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Scientists have rigorously examined general patterns surrounding memory suppression and hundreds of articles address corresponding cognitive and neuroscientific mechanisms. Although humans differ generally, and more so due to the effects of psychological conditions, little attention has been paid to the differences in memory suppression abilities among humans. The current studies address this gap in the literature by investigating potential individual differences in a memory suppression technique, the Think/No-Think paradigm, with respect to psychological traits of obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.\nIndividual differences in the accuracy of an event-related potential (ERP)-based knowledge detection system, Brain Fingerprinting, in the general population versus those with criminal histories are also reported. Brain Fingerprinting is used to detect the presence or absence of concealed knowledge related to a specific incident in a subject’s memory. The examination of two countermeasures in Brain Fingerprinting, direct-suppression and thought-substitution, are reported as well.\nThese studies were motivated by the fact that no empirical studies have reported individual differences in memory suppression due to psychological traits and no studies have tested the resistance of Brain Fingerprinting to memory suppression manipulations. To investigate these issues, four studies were designed that involved cognitive psychology, forensic neuroscience, and integrating cognitive psychology with forensic neuroscience. Study-1 and Study-2 addressed the Think/No-Think paradigm in relation to purported traits, Study-3 investigated Brain Fingerprinting, and Study-4 examined cognitive countermeasures to Brain Fingerprinting.\nThe Think/No-Think task is used to examine suppression of recently learned memories and its effect on subsequent recall. The paradigm consists of intentional retrieval suppression of one member of recently learned word pairs which are examined in a final recall test. In Study-1, an extension of the Think/No-Think paradigm was conducted with n = 24 university students using word pairs with a smaller frequency (12 repetitions) of suppression (No-Think) and facilitation (Think) trials than the standard Think/No-Think experiment (that used 16 repetitions). This study showed no significant temporary impairment in recollection of the suppressed members of word pairs when only 12 No-Think trials were used.\nStudy-2 investigated whether or not the capacity to suppress one member of the recently learned word pairs is impaired in people with higher Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores and in people with higher PTSD CheckList - Civilian Version (PCLC) scores, compared to those with lower scores. A large number of university students (n = 367) were screened to identify high and low scorers. N = 25 high YBOCS scorers, n = 27 high PCLC scorers, n = 28 low YBOCS scorers, and n = 29 low PCLC scorers participated in this study. To examine the differences, those with higher scores were examined to test if they had more difficulty suppressing memories using No-Think suppression than subjects with lower scores on YBOCS (Experiment-1), and on PCLC (Experiment-2), with the same frequency of Think and No-Think trials as Study-1 (i.e., 12). Each of these experiments (Experiment-1 and Experiment-2) showed a suppression effect due to the No-Think manipulation when the data of high and low scorers in either YBOCS or PCLC were combined. However, neither in YBOCS (comparing high scorers with low) nor in PCLC (comparing high scorers with low) was the capacity to suppress memories using No-Think significantly different between high and low scorers. Therefore, Study-2 did not confirm that the high scorers had more difficulty suppressing memories than the low scorers.\nThe effect of Think manipulation resulted in mixed outcomes: an overall increased recall due to Think manipulation was not observed in either Study-1 or Study-2. However, this effect interacted with different types of testing the recall, with a facilitation effect when recall was tested with the original cue but no facilitation effect when tested with an independent cue.\nStudy-3 is the first known study to examine the accuracy of Brain Fingerprinting in parolees (n = 17 subjects from a half-way house facility). Contrary to published Brain Fingerprinting studies dealing with the general population, Brain Fingerprinting was found to be less than 100% accurate in determining the guilt or innocence of parolees. In addition, this study also provided evidence that Brain Fingerprinting cannot be used with everyone, as several subjects could not complete the test for various reasons.\nStudy-4 investigated two cognitive techniques as potential countermeasures in Brain Fingerprinting (n = 36 university students). A modification of No-Think, direct-suppression, as well as another method known as thought-substitution were used as countermeasures. In Study-4 Experiment-1, Brain Fingerprinting was used to confirm that information related to specific life incidents was present in participants’ memories. Subsequently, in Experiment-2, both countermeasures were tested on the subjects of Experiment-1 in an attempt to render Brain Fingerprinting ineffective. Neither technique was found to be an effective countermeasures in Brain Fingerprinting.\nTogether, these results suggest that No-think suppression remains marginally effective with a smaller frequency of No-Think. However, there was no significant difference between the suppression capacity of high versus low scorers on psychological traits. In addition, these results have revealed limitations in the capacity of the current Brain Fingerprinting technique when applied to detection of information in persons with criminal histories. Notwithstanding, the results have also demonstrated the resistance of Brain Fingerprinting to direct-suppression and thought-substitution countermeasures."

    "text": "Scientists have rigorously examined general patterns surrounding memory suppression and hundreds of articles address corresponding cognitive and neuroscientific mechanisms. Although humans differ generally, and more so due to the effects of psychological conditions, little attention has been paid to the differences in memory suppression abilities among humans. The current studies address this gap in the literature by investigating potential individual differences in a memory suppression technique, the Think/No-Think paradigm, with respect to psychological traits of obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.\nIndividual differences in the accuracy of an event-related potential (ERP)-based knowledge detection system, Brain Fingerprinting, in the general population versus those with criminal histories are also reported. Brain Fingerprinting is used to detect the presence or absence of concealed knowledge related to a specific incident in a subject’s memory. The examination of two countermeasures in Brain Fingerprinting, direct-suppression and thought-substitution, are reported as well.\nThese studies were motivated by the fact that no empirical studies have reported individual differences in memory suppression due to psychological traits and no studies have tested the resistance of Brain Fingerprinting to memory suppression manipulations. To investigate these issues, four studies were designed that involved cognitive psychology, forensic neuroscience, and integrating cognitive psychology with forensic neuroscience. Study-1 and Study-2 addressed the Think/No-Think paradigm in relation to purported traits, Study-3 investigated Brain Fingerprinting, and Study-4 examined cognitive countermeasures to Brain Fingerprinting.\nThe Think/No-Think task is used to examine suppression of recently learned memories and its effect on subsequent recall. The paradigm consists of intentional retrieval suppression of one member of recently learned word pairs which are examined in a final recall test. In Study-1, an extension of the Think/No-Think paradigm was conducted with n = 24 university students using word pairs with a smaller frequency (12 repetitions) of suppression (No-Think) and facilitation (Think) trials than the standard Think/No-Think experiment (that used 16 repetitions).

    "text": "Following the March 15th Christchurch terrorist attack, members of our research team have been repeatedly asked to comment or provide summary statistics from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) on prejudice toward Muslims. As the curators of the NZAVS, we think that these findings should be in the public domain and accessible to as wide an audience as possible. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of what we know from the NZAVS about attitudes toward Muslims and prejudice in New Zealand more generally. From 2012 onwards, the NZAVS included a feeling thermometer rating of people’s level of warmth toward Muslims. Here, we summarize what we know from the NZAVS about levels of warmth toward Muslims in the New Zealand population. We describe the distribution of thermometer ratings of warmth toward Muslims annually from 2012 onward, and compare these with thermometer ratings of a range of other groups that we also track. We present a regression model documenting the extent to which a broad range of demographics and aspects of personality are associated with low levels of warmth toward Muslims, and present a parallel model assessing warmth ratings toward immigrants as a comparison. Finally, we present a series of growth curve models outlining the relative level and rate of change over time in warmth toward Muslims and other groups from 2012- 2018. Results from these analyses indicate that over the 2012-2018 period, levels of warmth toward Muslims in New Zealand were comparatively low relative to warmth ratings of other groups. However, warmth toward Muslims has also been steadily but gradually increasing over time in New Zealand."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Natural (e.g., earthquake, flood, wildfires) and human-made (e.g., terrorism, civil strife) disasters are inevitable, can cause extensive disruption, and produce chronic and disabling psychological injuries leading to formal diagnoses (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]). Following natural disasters of earthquake (Christchurch, Aotearoa/New Zealand, 2010–11) and flood (Calgary, Canada, 2013), controlled research showed statistically and clinically significant reductions in psychological distress for survivors who consumed minerals and vitamins (micronutrients) in the following months. Following a mass shooting in Christchurch (March 15, 2019), where a gunman entered mosques during Friday prayers and killed and injured many people, micronutrients were offered to survivors as a clinical service based on translational science principles and adapted to be culturally appropriate. In this first translational science study in the area of nutrition and disasters, clinical results were reported for 24 clients who completed the Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), and the Modified-Clinical Global Impression (M-CGI-I). The findings clearly replicated prior controlled research. The IES-R Cohen’s d ESs were 1.1 (earthquake), 1.2 (flood), and 1.13 (massacre). Effect sizes (ESs) for the DASS subscales were also consistently positive across all three events. The M-CGI-I identified 58% of the survivors as “responders” (i.e., self-reported as “much” to “very much” improved), in line with those reported in the earthquake (42%) and flood (57%) randomized controlled trials, and PTSD risk reduced from 75% to 17%. Given ease of use and large ESs, this evidence supports the routine use of micronutrients by disaster survivors as part of governmental response."

Following these events, there was a noticable rise in societal acceptance of Muslim minorities. Comparable transient reactions have been observed elsewhere. However, the critical questions remain: can these effects endure? Are enduring effects evident across the political spectrum? It is challenging to answer such questions because identifying long-term causal effects requires estimating unobserved attitudinal trajectories without the attacks. Here, we use six preattack waves of Muslim acceptance responses from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) to infer missing counterfactual trajectories (NZAVS cohort 2012, N = 4,865⁠; replicated in 2013 cohort, N = 7,894⁠). We find (1) the attacks initially boosted Muslim acceptance; (2) the magnitude of the initial Muslim acceptance boost was similar across the political spectrum; (3) no changes were observed in negative control groups; and (4) two- and three-year effects varied by baseline political orientation: liberal acceptance was stable, conservative acceptance grew relative to the counterfactual trend. Overall, the attacks added five years of growth in Muslim acceptance, with no regression to preattack levels over time. Continued growth among conservatives highlights the attack’s failure to divide society. These results demonstrate the utility of combining methods for causal inference with national-scale panel data to answer psychological questions of basic human concern."

To investigate whether free first-year education could mitigate financial stress in New Zealand tertiary education students, 270 psychology students from the University of Canterbury completed scales measuring financial stress, perceived socio-economic status, and debt attitude as well as demographic status and financial status variables over a series of two experiments. The efficacy of the New Zealand government’s free first-year tertiary education policy on reducing students’ financial stress was investigated in contrast with taking a temporal discounting approach, i.e. putting less value on future gains: Half of the participants were primed with a paragraph regarding free first-year education. Students’ financial stress increased with increasing debt, inability to save money, and thinking that one’s weekly income was not sufficient for living needs, but objective financial status variables such as their income, receiving Student Allowance, and part-time employment were not associated with students’ financial stress. Priming with the government’s free first-year education policy did not decrease first-year students’ financial stress, indicating that the students were taking a temporal discounting approach. Overall, the findings suggest that 1) the government’s focus could usefully shift to students’ present financial concerns and 2) students’ financial counselling and financial management skills could be enhanced."

Priming with the government’s free first-year education policy did not decrease first-year students’ financial stress, indicating that the students were taking a temporal discounting approach. Overall, the findings suggest that 1) the government’s focus could usefully shift to students’ present financial concerns and 2) students’ financial counselling and financial management skills could be enhanced."

    "text": "Brain Fingerprinting (BFP) is an electroencephalogram-based system used to detect knowledge, or absence of knowledge of a real-life incident (e.g., a crime) in a person’s memory. With the help of BFP, a potential crime suspect can be classified as possessing crime-related information (Information-Present), not possessing crime-related information (Information-Absent), or Indeterminate (BFP unable to classify a subject). In the lab setting, we compare the ground-truth of a subject (i.e., real-life involvement in an incident) against their classification based on BFP testing. We report two studies: replication of BFP with university students (Study 1) and replication of BFP with parolees (Study 2). In Study 1, we tested 31 subjects (24 females, seven males, mean age = 21.3) on either their own or another subject’s real-life incident. BFP correctly classified nine Information-Present and 18 Information-Absent subjects, but with one false positive and three exclusions. In Study 2, we tested 17 male parolees (mean age = 47.5) on their own or another parolee’s crime incident. BFP correctly classified two Information-Present and six Information-Absent subjects. However, there was also one false positive classification and three Indeterminates. Additionally, we identified three subjects who could not complete the BFP testing and two exclusions. We posit that BFP is not yet at a stage to be considered a robust and accurate crime-detection tool as claimed in former articles. Nevertheless, after addressing the limitations, BFP has considerable potential as an information detection tool in forensic investigations, especially for detecting idiosyncratic crime-relevant knowledge in a perpetrator, in addition to helping to confirm the accuracy of a suspect’s claim of innocence."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article examines the impact of the March 15, 2019 far-right terrorist attack against Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand on public opinion toward Muslims. It also examines whether the impact of the attack varies for individuals across the political spectrum. We make use of data from the 2019 New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (N = 47,951) to compare the attitudes of New Zealanders before and after the attack. Using a range of statistical techniques, including regression discontinuity analysis, we find robust evidence that the attack led to an immediate increase in warmth toward Muslims. We also show that this increase was driven by both left-wing/liberal and right-wing/conservative individuals in the immediate days after the attack. Soon after the attack, however, attitudes toward Muslims among the politically conservative population tended to revert to pre-attack levels. By contrast, political liberals maintained their heightened level of positive attitudes for a longer period. We discuss the possible theoretical reasons for these findings."

    "text": "This article examines the impact of the March 15, 2019 far-right terrorist attack against Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand on public opinion toward Muslims. It also examines whether the impact of the attack varies for individuals across the political spectrum. We make use of data from the 2019 New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (N = 47,951) to compare the attitudes of New Zealanders before and after the attack. Using a range of statistical techniques, including regression discontinuity analysis, we find robust evidence that the attack led to an immediate increase in warmth toward Muslims. We also show that this increase was driven by both left-wing/liberal and right-wing/conservative individuals in the immediate days after the attack. Soon after the attack, however, attitudes toward Muslims among the politically conservative population tended to revert to pre-attack levels. By contrast, political liberals maintained their heightened level of positive attitudes for a longer period. We discuss the possible theoretical reasons for these findings."

    "title": "Exploring New Zealand National Identity and Its Importance for Attitudes toward Muslims and Support for Diversity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the aftermath of the horrific terrorist attack against Muslims in Christchurch, it is important to examine what psychological factors predict positive attitudes toward Muslims and acceptance of diversity, more broadly. The present work examines how beliefs about national identity predict attitudes toward Muslims and support for diversity in New Zealand. Using a national sample, we first describe the extent to which New Zealanders rate various characteristics as important for being a ‘true’ New Zealander. We then examine how such beliefs about national character predict attitudes toward Muslims and diversity. Results revealed that the more people believe that having specific ancestral heritage and certain cultural characteristics are important for being a ‘true’ New Zealander, the more negativity they expressed about Muslims and the more opposition they expressed toward diversity. However, endorsement of more civic characteristics (e.g., respect for the nation’s institutions and laws) was unrelated to attitudes toward Muslims and support for diversity. Taken together, this work reveals that how we define who we are as a nation influences how we feel about Muslims and diversity. Broader implications for the future of cultural diversity in New Zealand are also discussed."

    "text": "Role: Researcher\nForensic Brainwave Analysis currently has three areas: Brain Fingerprinting (BFP), Complex Trial Protocol and Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling.\nBFP is an ERP*-based knowledge detection technology aiming to detect concealed knowledge pertaining to an incident (criminal or otherwise) in a person’s brain. BFP can also detect if a certain person has knowledge specific to a specific group or organisation (e.g., FBI).\nBFP was invented in the early 1990s by Dr Lawrence (Larry) Farwell - currently the Chief Science Officer of the Brain Fingerprinting Technologies.\nDuring my PhD at University of Canterbury, I worked with academics from psychology and law in a New Zealand Law Foundation project to replicate the accuracy and reliability of the BFP technology with general population and with parolees.\nAn EEG headset (see the figure) and a computer software are used in this technology."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Think/No-Think (T/NT) paradigm is an influential approach to studying the control of unwanted memories. Participants first learn a series of cue-target pairs (e.g., BEACH-AFRICA) until the cue reliably elicits the target; then for a subset of the cues (BEACH) they practice avoiding retrieval of the associated target (AFRICA). Evidence from this paradigm suggests that intentionally not retrieving unwanted experiences renders those experiences less accessible at test. This is referred to as the Suppression-Induced Forgetting (SIF) effect, and has been linked to a variety of conditions involving unwanted past or future experiences. The SIF effect obtained with independent retrieval cues has been suggested to provide compelling evidence for the existence of cognitive inhibition. However, some researchers have questioned its replicability. The present Registered Report will address these concerns by replicating the T/NT paradigm using two common instructional variants (Thought Substitution and Thought Avoidance) previously shown to reduce the accessibility of unwanted memories.\nThe OSF page for the project, click here."
