I am the lead researcher (principal investigator) of the [Muslim Diversity Study](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/research/about-uc-research/research-specialities-and-projects/research-projects/the-muslim-diversity-study), currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow and lecturer in the School of Psychology, Speech and Hearing at the University of Canterbury (Christchurch, New Zealand).

In the multi-city longitudinal Muslim Diversity Study, my team and I concentrate on investigating the effects of religion on social attitudes, values, resilience, flourishing, meaning-making, overall well-being, and experiences of Muslims in New Zealand. In this capacity, I lead a team of 28 research assistants and numerous collaborators, fostering a collaborative and enriching research environment.

During PhD, I  received training in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, with a primary emphasis on memory suppression and utilising brainwave (EEG/ERP) data to examine possession of criminal knowledge. Additionally, my research encompasses contemplative neuroscience, where I aim to explore neural correlates of contemplative practices.

I use experimental (behavioural as well as neuroscientific) and observational methods.

**Fields of Research**

-   Human Flourishing
-   Psychology of Religion
-   Contemplative Neuroscience
-   Cognitive Psychology: memory control
-   Forensic Neuroscience

**Current Projects**

-   As principal investigator (`PI`) and `postdoctoral research fellow` in the [Muslim Diversity Study](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/research/about-uc-research/research-specialities-and-projects/research-projects/the-muslim-diversity-study)
-   As `PI` in [Controlling unwanted memories: A multisite registered replication of the Think/No-Think effect](https://osf.io/nru4x/?view_only=bc189174a1cf4ca8b1dc83cf7967cd9e)
-   As `PI` in [Resting EEG microstates during contemplative practices](https://osf.io/ns5zm/)
-   As `PI` in the "Artificial Intelligence-Based Crime Detection in Aotearoa: Real-life and Virtual Reality Applications"

**Research Supervision**

Since 2021, I have developed a track record of effective leading and supervising research at different levels (PhD, Masters, and Honours).

**Teaching**

My experience encompasses teaching statistics, research methods, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience, consistently earning positive feedback each year. I take pride in my ability to embrace constructive criticism and continuously enhance my teaching approach. Currently, I teach the following courses:

-   Postgraduate [Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience](https://courseinfo.canterbury.ac.nz/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC480&occurrence=24S1(C)&year=2024) (2023-Present).
-   Undergraduate [Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics](https://courseinfo.canterbury.ac.nz/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC344&occurrence=23S2(C)&year=2023) (2022-2024).

**Grants**

-   A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing

**Awards**

-   [UC Foundation](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/uc-foundation/) Doctoral Publication Prize
-   Georgina Carvell Memorial Prize
-   [Te Puna Toiora](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/research/about-uc-research/research-groups-and-centres/te-puna-toiora-mental-health-and-nutrition-research) Scholarship
-   [University of Canterbury Doctoral Scholarship](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/get-started/scholarships/types/doctoral-scholarships/)
-   Stage 4 Psychology Prize

**Coding**

I use `GitHub` with `RStudio` and `Quarto` to learn, produce, and share code. Occasionally, I use `Matlab` and `Python` too.

**Career Goals**

My immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) lecturer in the field of `psychology of religion`, `human flourishing`, `neuroscience`, or `research methods`. Psychology and science fascinate me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science.
