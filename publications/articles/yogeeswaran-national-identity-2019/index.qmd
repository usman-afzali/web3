## Abstract
:::{#yogeeswaran-2019}
:::

In the aftermath of the horrific terrorist attack against Muslims in Christchurch, it is important to examine
what psychological factors predict positive attitudes toward Muslims and acceptance of diversity, more
broadly. The present work examines how beliefs about national identity predict attitudes toward Muslims
and support for diversity in New Zealand. Using a national sample, we first describe the extent to which
New Zealanders rate various characteristics as important for being a ‘true’ New Zealander. We then
examine how such beliefs about national character predict attitudes toward Muslims and diversity. Results
revealed that the more people believe that having specific ancestral heritage and certain cultural
characteristics are important for being a ‘true’ New Zealander, the more negativity they expressed about
Muslims and the more opposition they expressed toward diversity. However, endorsement of more civic
characteristics (e.g., respect for the nation’s institutions and laws) was unrelated to attitudes toward
Muslims and support for diversity. Taken together, this work reveals that how we define who we are as a
nation influences how we feel about Muslims and diversity. Broader implications for the future of cultural
diversity in New Zealand are also discussed.

## Important figure

Figures 1a-1d. The figures presented display the distribution of responses as percentages from participants when asked how important do they personally think the following qualities are for being a true New Zealander, where 1 = not important, 4 = somewhat important, and 7 = very important.
