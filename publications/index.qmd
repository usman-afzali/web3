My fields of research include human flourishing, psychology of religion, contemplative neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and forensic neuroscience.
I study Islamophobia; life-satisfaction, flourishing and resilience in religious groups, memory suppression, forensic brainwave analysis, and neural correlates of contemplative and ritual practices. 
I use experimental (behavioural as well as neuroscientific) and observational methods.
In my current research project (int'l replication + panel Muslim data)
